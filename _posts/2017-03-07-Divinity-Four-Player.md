## Divinity: Original Sin Four Player Patcher

I made a [patcher](https://github.com/krisives/divinityfourplayer) for *Divinity: Original Sin* (including Enhanced Edition) that modifies the game from 2 players to 4 players. Thanks to the community for cataloging the byte signatures for patching and for Nazar for putting it into [his guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=548760493).
