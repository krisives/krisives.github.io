Some of you may have asked why I was involved in the `go-ethereum` [issue](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/2715#issuecomment-227684657). This was a joke about how anyone who has lost coins should get their own default soft fork command line flag. From what I read from [their release](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases/tag/v1.4.8) it would appear they switched it to `--dao-soft-fork` making instead of making it default.

Assuming these forks go through I don't know how much anyone can trust Ethereum to not change the outcome of smart contracts. I think it's going to be a hard hit to the main selling point of a decentralized contract enforcement platform.
