---
More work has been done on the [Assembly Cup](https://github.com/asmcup/runtime) robot programming competition. The debugger has been improved and the world is more stable allowing folks to test their bots better.

A Reddit user has ported the VM to Javascript which will be avalable as [asmcup/runtime-js](https://github.com/asmcup/runtime-js) hopefully soon. This will help with getting some tools to work within the web browser.

Also reached out to [YTCracker](https://twitter.com/realytcracker) to see if he wanted to participate and he said he was gonna check it out and possibly contribute.

Anyone interested should participate!
