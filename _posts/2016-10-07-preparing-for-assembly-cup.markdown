I'm running a contest where everyone gets a little robot in a virtual world. The robot cannot be controlled directly via a keyboard or controller, but rather has to be programmed to be autonomous. Within the virtual game world robots navigate obstacles, hazards and collect loot.

The contest will begin in November 2016. The VM spec is subject to change slightly between now and then, but overall if you start writing some assembler now and keep the source you can recompile your code later. However, machine learners and genetic algorithms folks will have to wait a bit.

Check out the [asmcup/runtime](https://github.com/asmcup/runtime) for the VM, Compiler, and some other tools.

More info soon once the Sandbox code is pushed so you can test your robot in a mock world.
